## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

\newpage
Using R with R mark down

hist(frog$egg.size)
median (frog$egg.size)

``` {r sample_data, eval= TRUE} 
sample.data= matrix(1:9, nrow= 3, byrow = T)
save(sample.data, file = "sample_data.Rdata")
rm(list= ls())
load ("sample_data.Rdata")
boxplot(sample.data)
```
